### Preparation ###

1. Copy this entire folder into your own repository.  Make sure the folder name
remains the same.
2. Commit and push to your repository.  Verify that you can see it online.
3. You can continue to commit and push often.  
4. When you think you're done, create a file named "GRADE.md" with one line in the file that says "I'm done", a riddle, or an interesting tidbit of computer science trivia. (This is because Git won't push empty files). Then commit and push your changes. 

### Instructions

This assignment will help you get practice with HTML and a bit of CSS.

Challenge: Make an HTML version of [syllabus.pdf](syllabus.pdf). Feel free to copy and paste the text into your code as needed.

Try to make your webpage look like the PDF as much as possible. Think about fonts, colors, margins, and borders.

HINT: You may need to research some HTML elements not covered in the videos in order to match the layout in the "Grading Policy" and "Tentative Weekly Schedule" sections.

**Grading Rubric**

* 3 points: Overall appearance, layout, and spacing
* 2 points: Closely matching fonts and typography
