        <h2>MPCS 52553 - Web Development</h2>
        <h3>Course Description</h3>
        <p>
            This course provides students with an introduction to web application development. The primary focus of the course is on front-end development: modern HTML5/CSS3/ES6 coding and frameworks. The course also spends some time surveying server-side technologies, but it's not a primary focus.
            <br></br>
            This is primarily a flipped course, with 1-2 hours of video to digest each week, plus a 60-90 minute interactive class session. Zoom breakouts will be used during the class sessions to enable students to collaborate on various challenges.
            <br></br>
            We will also rely on Slack (or Ed) for class communication between lectures, and office hours will all be remotely held on Zoom. 
        </p>
